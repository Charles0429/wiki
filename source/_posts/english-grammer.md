#  英语语法总结

## 时态

### 现在进行时

I am doing something表示正在做某事，已经开始了，但还未结束。

几种场景：


#### 说话时正在做某事

例如，Where is Mark? He's having a shower
#### 说话时并没有正在做某事，但已经开始了，尚未结束

Steve is talking to a good friend on the phone. He says: I'm reading a really good book at the moment, It's about...

#### 对于today/this week/ this year在做的事情，可以用现在进行时

You're working hard today.
#### 对于当前发生的变化，也用现在完成时

主要针对的词有get,change,become,increase,rise,fall,grow,improve,begin和start。

例如, is your English getting better?

### 一般现在时

某事经常发生或重复发生，或者某事发生是常识性的。

例如， The cafe opens at 7.30 in the moring.

I get up at 8 o'clock every morning.

#### 特殊用法

I always do something， 我经常做某事

I'm always doing something， 强调事情发生的频率超过正常

I always go to work by car.

I'm always losing things.

think, see, hear, smell, taste, look和feel等通常用一般现在时

### 过去时

I did something， 过去做过某事。

### 过去进行时

I was doing something，过去正在做某事，已经开始，但没有结束。

例子，I was walking home when I met Dan. (in the middle of walking home)

### 现在完成时

I have done something. 一般指完成了某事，并对现在有一定的影响。

例如，He has lost his key = He lost it recently, and he still doesn't have it.

### 现在完成进行时

当某件事请刚刚结束，并对现在造成一定影响时，使用现在完成进行时。

例如，You're out of breath. Have you ben runninng?

现在完成进行时强调事件本身，而现在完成时强调事件的结果。

### 过去完成时

I had done something，过去完成某事，并对过去有影响。

例如，When Sarah arrived at the party, Paul had already gone home.

had done VS have done

``` 
                     now
   have seen--------->|
                      |

## 未来

### 现在时态表示未来

主要有三种：

#### I'm doing somthing

已经决定去做，并且安排好了。

What are you doing on Saturday evening?

#### I'm going to do something

已经决定去做，但可能没安排好

What are you going to do on Saturday evening?

#### I do something

一般跟时间表有关。

例如，What time does the film start this evening?

### will/shall

Ｉ'll表示我刚刚决定去做某事。

例如，Oh, I've left the door open. I'll go and shut it.

之前已经决定去做，并且安排好的，不能使用will，例如, Are you working tommorrow?

shall则主要是在疑问句中使用，表示询问某人的意见。

## 情态动词

### can, could and be able to

- can:something is possible or allowed, or that somebody has the ability to do something
- could: past form of can
- be able to: can has only two forms, so sometime it is neccessary to use be able to

### may and might

may/might来表达某事有一定可能性发生。

否定形式为may not/ might not。

过去时为may have done/might have done。

might 和 may的区别在于，当说话时场景不是真实时，用might.

#### 特殊用法

might as well = We should do it because there is no better alternative. There is no reason not to do it.

### must/have to

#### 特殊用法

He didn't need to do something = it was not necessary to do it. It doesn't matter whether he did it or not.

### should

例如，I insisted that he should apologise.

if something should happen, 表达某事发生概率较小。

You're always at home. You should go out more often. 普通场景。

### It's time

It's time to do something.

## if and wish

### If I do … and If I did

一个例子：

- 场景1

JESS: If we go by bus, it will be cheaper.

For Jess, it is possble that they will go by bus

- 场景2

Lisa and Jess decide to go by train.

Later, Jess talks to Joe.

Joe: How are you going to travel?

### If I knew.. I wish I knew

一个例子：

Sarah wants to phone Paul, but she can't do this because she doesn't know his number. She says:

If I knew his number, I would phone him.

表达的时候，假象的一个场景，使用if + past，并不表示真的是过去式。

同样的I wish I knew也是类似的。

I wish I knew Paul's phone number.  = (I don't know it and I regret this).

## Relative clauses

A clause is a part of a sentence. A relative clause tells us which person or thing the speaker means.

### clauses with who/that/which

The woman **who lives the next door** is a doctor.

- We use **who** in a relative clause when we are talking about people.

You can also use **that** (instead of **who**), but you can't use **which** for people.

- When we are talking about things, we use **that** or **which** in a relative clause

I don't like stories that have unhappy endings.

**That** is more usual than **which**.

- What = the thing that

What happened was my fault.

### clauses with and without who/that/which

- You must use **who/that/which** when it is subject of the relative clause.

The woman who lives next door is a doctor.

Here who = the woman, is the *subject*

so, 'The woman lives next door is a doctor' is wrong.

- when **who/that/which** is the object, you can leave it out.

The women **who** I wanted to see was away on holiday.

who = I wanted to see the woman = the object.

The women I wanted to see was away on holiday.

- What = the things that

Did you hear what they said? ( = the things that they said)

### whose whome where

- We use **whose** in relative clauses instead of **his/her/their**

We helped some people whose car had broken down.

We hepled some people - their car had broken down.

- **whom** is possible instead of **who** when it is the *object* of the verb in the relative clause

Gegore is a person **whom I admire** very much. (I admire him.)

Whom is a formal word and we do not often use it in this way, we usually prefer **who** or **that**, or nothing.

- where
