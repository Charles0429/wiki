#  英语语法总结

## 时态

### 现在进行时

I am doing something表示正在做某事，已经开始了，但还未结束。

几种场景：


#### 说话时正在做某事

例如，Where is Mark? He's having a shower
#### 说话时并没有正在做某事，但已经开始了，尚未结束

Steve is talking to a good friend on the phone. He says: I'm reading a really good book at the moment, It's about...

#### 对于today/this week/ this year在做的事情，可以用现在进行时

You're working hard today.
#### 对于当前发生的变化，也用现在完成时

主要针对的词有get,change,become,increase,rise,fall,grow,improve,begin和start。

例如, is your English getting better?

### 一般现在时

某事经常发生或重复发生，或者某事发生是常识性的。

例如， The cafe opens at 7.30 in the moring.

I get up at 8 o'clock every morning.

#### 特殊用法

I always do something， 我经常做某事

I'm always doing something， 强调事情发生的频率超过正常

I always go to work by car.

I'm always losing things.

think, see, hear, smell, taste, look和feel等通常用一般现在时

### 过去时

I did something， 过去做过某事。

### 过去进行时

I was doing something，过去正在做某事，已经开始，但没有结束。

例子，I was walking home when I met Dan. (in the middle of walking home)

### 现在完成时

I have done something. 一般指完成了某事，并对现在有一定的影响。

例如，He has lost his key = He lost it recently, and he still doesn't have it.

### 现在完成进行时

当某件事请刚刚结束，并对现在造成一定影响时，使用现在完成进行时。

例如，You're out of breath. Have you ben runninng?

现在完成进行时强调事件本身，而现在完成时强调事件的结果。

### 过去完成时

例如，When Sarah arrived at the party, Paul had already gone home.

had done VS have done

``` 
                     now
   have seen--------->|
                      |
----------------------------->

                     past       now
   had seen---------->|          |
                      |          |

```

### 过去完成进行时

                      |          |
----------------------------------->
```

## 未来

### 现在时态表示未来

主要有三种：

#### I'm doing somthing

已经决定去做，并且安排好了。

What are you doing on Saturday evening?

#### I'm going to do something

已经决定去做，但可能没安排好

What are you going to do on Saturday evening?

#### I do something

一般跟时间表有关。

例如，What time does the film start this evening?

### will/shall

Ｉ'll表示我刚刚决定去做某事。

例如，Oh, I've left the door open. I'll go and shut it.

之前已经决定去做，并且安排好的，不能使用will，例如, Are you working tommorrow?

shall则主要是在疑问句中使用，表示询问某人的意见。

Shall I open the window?　(= Do you want me to open the window).

## 情态动词

### can, could and be able to

- can:something is possible or allowed, or that somebody has the ability to do something
- could: past form of can
- be able to: can has only two forms, so sometime it is neccessary to use be able to

For example:

- Tom can come tomorrow
- Tom might be able to come tomorrow

could除了是can的过去时外，还有一些特殊用法：

- 表达可能的行为

What shall we do tonight?

We could go to the cinema.

- 表达不现实的行为

I'm so tired, I  could sleep for a week.

### must/can't

must表达相信某事一定是对的

can't表达相信某事一定是不可能的

过去式为must have done and can't have done.

### may and might

may/might来表达某事有一定可能性发生。

否定形式为may not/ might not。

过去时为may have done/might have done。

might 和 may的区别在于，当说话时场景不是真实时，用might.

If the paid me better, I might work harder.

#### 特殊用法

might as well = We should do it because there is no better alternative. There is no reason not to do it.

### must/have to

have to表达某人有责任做某事

must表示某人的观点，认为应该做某事。

### must mustn't needn't

You must do something = It is necessary that you do it.

You mustn't do something = It is necessary that you do not do it.

needn't or don't need to = It is not necessary to do it.

#### 特殊用法

He needn't have done something = he did it, but now we know that it was not necessary.

He didn't need to do something = it was not necessary to do it. It doesn't matter whether he did it or not.

### should

You should do something = it is a good thing to do or the right thing to do. You can use should to give advice or to give an opinion.

We also use should to say that we expect something to happen.

You should have done something = you didn't do it, but it would have been the right thing to do.

You shouldn't have done something = you did it, but it was the wrong time to do.

#### 固定用法

insist, recommend, suggest, demand and propose一般用should。

例如，I insisted that he should apologise.

if something should happen, 表达某事发生概率较小。

### had better

I'd better/you'd better

I'd better do something = it is advisable to do it. If I don't do it, there will  be a problem of danger.

It's late. You'd better go/You should go. 特殊场景。

You're always at home. You should go out more often. 普通场景。

### It's time

It's time to do something.

It's time somebody did something = they should have already done it or started it. For example, it's time they were here. Why are they so late?

### Would

We use would/wouldn't when we imagine a situation or action.

例句，It would be nice to buy a new car, but we can't afford it.

#### 特殊用法

### Can/Could/Would you … ?

表达请求时常用的句式。

could you wait a moment, please?

Would you please be quiet? I'm trying to concentrate.

Would you like a cup of tea?

## if and wish

### If I do … and If I did

一个例子：

- 场景1

Lisa: Shall we go by bus or by train?

JESS: If we go by bus, it will be cheaper.

For Jess, it is possble that they will go by bus

- 场景2

Lisa and Jess decide to go by train.

Later, Jess talks to Joe.

Joe: How are you going to travel?

Jess: We're going by train. If we went by bus, it would be cheaper, but the train is faster.

### If I knew.. I wish I knew

一个例子：

Sarah wants to phone Paul, but she can't do this because she doesn't know his number. She says:

If I knew his number, I would phone him.

表达的时候，假象的一个场景，使用if + past，并不表示真的是过去式。

同样的I wish I knew也是类似的。

I wish I knew Paul's phone number.  = (I don't know it and I regret this).

## 被动语态

be done

例如:

被动语态：This house was built in 1961.

主动语态：Somebody built this house in 1961.

还有部分get的固定用法，但并不表示被动
